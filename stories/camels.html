<p class="stitle"> Abyss or Camels </p>

<p class="paragraph"> The abyss and the abyss of the abyss. A billion abysses, each one a face with its own abyss, or like a billion faces stuccoed on the wall of the room, or like a billion camels stuccoed on the wall of the room. Words such as "limnetic" which means occurring in the deep waters of a lake. Deep blue like the ocean or transparent deepness. Feared like green and brown. Algae and the derivatives of algae. The power of words and the power of algae. Carrageenan, an algae derivative. The dogs and the infinite dog kennels. Throwing them to the dog kennels to be devoured. Brown and red. The color and interpretation of images. Images passing rapidly before the eyes. Trees with green leaves and red hanging pods. Praising images and the generation of images, grey-blue and white, God being an image. Two massive snakes in the sky open their mouths and join their fangs in the sky. Faceless silent men leading us. A coin, the number two, the color yellow. Being splayed like a dried butterfly. The mirror of time and water as time's mirror, so that the flow of water mirrors time's flow. The small people in my backyard holding up literal mirrors. God or you, God or you, revolving, first God then you, a spinning wheel with mirror panels. A pinwheel or a miniature Merry-Go-Round. The mirror of animals, animals mirrored on animals. Bird mirrored on bird. Open mouths mirrored by open mouths. Black and red. Symmetries mirrored on symmetries. The mirroring of symmetries also mirrored. The mirroring of mirrored symmetries also mirrored. Higher-order symmetries increasing without bound. An image of God's body or of your body. The proliferation of images, the proliferation of symmetries. Symmetries stacked like the tower of Babel, symmetries towering over the Earth. Purple air, purple dirt. Massive red cliffs in the sunset. Deer move below on purple ground. A large bug looking at me with large eyes, a look of disappointment, round body, eyes half-closed by purple eyelids.</p>
