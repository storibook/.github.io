<p class="stitle"> The Defense </p>
<p class="info">&#9998; Jan 2024</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Socrates stood up and addressed the hall: I have been asked to defend myself against a strange charge that carries the death sentence. Apparently it is not enough that I am mortal and that I will die of old age, as none of you will, since you are all immortal, and that instead I should be put down like a dog by the people I have known my whole life. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> I have been charged with corrupting immortality, as if immortality is something that can be corrupted. Can the river Ocean that circles the world be muddied by a clod of dirt? Remember how my mother felt when the oracle told her that she would birth the first person to be born in hundreds of years. Imagine the terror and the excitement she felt. And you all remember the horror and fascination of watching me grow old, past the prime of my life — at which point everyone else stops aging — watching me wrinkle and my hair turn white. Not only was I the first person born in centuries, I was going to be the first person to die in millenia, since the war with the Titans. In short, I am nothing and am capable of corrupting nothing. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Out of respect for the institution I won't defend myself against this stupid charge. Instead, I will explain to you that I have already outlived all of you. Please quiet down. Even if I were to take the hemlock tomorrow, I would have outlived all of you. Many of you think I am joking, but I am not. To prove this I will appeal to an authority that needs no defending. I am talking about the God at Delphi. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Aristophanes, who we all know is a jokester, made the trip to Delphi and asked the Pythia, knowing that only dogs would die before I did: Who will outlive Socrates? And the God of Delphi spoke through the Pythia: Not a single person will outlive Socrates. When I heard this, I thought to myself: What is the meaning of this riddle? Everybody knows that everyone in this world except me will live until the sun dies. How could it be that no one will outlive me? Maybe it was a joke that I didn't understand. All I had to do was bring a single person to Delphi and say: Oh Oracle, here is a person that will outlive me, surely you were mistaken. But when I started looking I couldn't find a person to take. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> First I talked with a king because I thought that a king's immortality is of a higher quality than the immortality of a normal person. But as I talked with him I realized that he had already died. I told him this, and he denied it, and eventually we went to his city's recordkeeper, and it turned out that he had actually died. He simply forgot that he did. The king did not like me for this, though I had told him the truth, and I left the city in a hurry, and he has been my enemy since. I then talked to a few other kings and a few warriors, whose immortality is also greater because of the glory they won in some battle, and in each case it turned out that the person I was talking to was dead. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> After I had talked to kings I talked to gods, because surely the Pythia would appreciate that I brought a god before her. But with gods the situation was only a little better than with the kings. None of the gods I talked to had died, which gave me hope that one of them would outlive me. But it turned out that none of them had been born either, and that none of them had ever existed. Not one single god I talked to, we found out as we talked things over, turned out to have existed at all, not even in the moment of our conversation (imagine their surprise!) did they exist, and so none of them could outlive me. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Finally I turned to ordinary people whose immortality was assured because they were very, very old. This was the strangest case. The first person I talked to was so old that he resembled dirt, he was covered in moss, he didn't remember his name. But he did remember an episode from his childhood, of a silver hunter coming in the daylight to take something from him. We examined this memory for hours and concluded that the silver hunter, some terrible god, was, first, not from this world and, second, had come to take his soul. And so he had stopped living on that day. With every person I talked to it was the same story, I even talked to younger people and each one remembered the same thing. Some remember a silver hunter, others remember a farmhand with a silver reaper, and some remember the episode as being raped. But each person I talked to turned out to be, if not dead, then not living. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Now it has become my life's work to carry out the work of the god, and I spend every day looking for a person that might outlive me. Still, I have come to accept what the oracle said, that no one will outlive me, and further that I am the only person remaining alive. I am frightened, my life has become hell because I am surrounded by ghosts and by the shadows of ghosts, and I often ask myself if I also am dead. Why should I be the special case? In fact, it must be that I am already dead, and what the oracle meant was: Although Socrates is already dead, everybody had died before him.  </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Why have I been condemned to this? And if it's true that I'm dead, then how am I thinking these thoughts and feeling these feelings? When I scream in the night, where does the scream come from, and when I cut myself in the night, why does blood flow, and from where do all these tears come from? </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Socrates rested his case and sat down. The votes were made and tallied and Socrates lost by a narrow margin. Three days later, surrounded by his closest followers, he was given hemlock and he took it, saying: Why should I fear death if all of you are already dead? </p>
