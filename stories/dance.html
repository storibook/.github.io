<p class="stitle"> Dance of Death </p>
<p class="info">&#9998; Feb 2024</p>
<p class="paragraph"> The flowers dancing in the fields and death dancing in the fields. Red flowers quickly sprout from the ground and do the dance of death before quickly retracting into the ground. The dance of death that the eyes dance as the human looks for something to eat. The dance of death that the bird does to greet the morning sun. The dance that the night dances as the dance of death. The dance of the shapes as the dance of death and the music the shapes dance to. Imagining the music of the dance of death. The rotation of the earth as the music of the dance of death or the music of the dance of death as a clarinet song. The dance of death that the rocks dance and the music they dance to. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Death without end. In every moment I die and in every moment a miracle brings me to life. In every moment I see the mouth of the blue wave of annihilation and in every moment I see the womb of the apple of God's mouth. Every second I exist is the wilting of the flower of God's mouth. I see moons pass their cycles in the corners of my vision and I see suns consume themselves in the center of my vision. I see endless rows of deadly blue apples. I see rows of cliffs, each one taller than the last one, and I see rows of false Mariana Trenches, each one deeper than the last one. Only one of them is as deep as the real Mariana Trench. I see fields and hyper-fields of eyes. I see the eyes of animals and I see the faces of humans reflected in the eyes of animals. I see gargantuan stone guards with stone swords and I see endless rows of animals and their eyes. I see the oceans that are reflected in their eyes and I see the ponds that are reflected in their eyes. And I see your eyes or I see myself reflected in your eyes. I don't exist outside of your eyes and in every second your vision is my birth. I am annihilated in your blinking. In your right hand you hold a sword called <em>my first annihilation</em> and in your left hand you hold a spear called <em>my second annihilation.</em> When your blinking is not annihilating me your sword is annihilating me and your spear is annihilating me. Annihilation and pleasure without end. </p>
