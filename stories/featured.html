<p class="stitle"> The Dream of Your Mouth </p>
<p class="info">&#9998; Nov 2023</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Last night you came to me in a dream or what I hope was a dream. At five in the morning you knocked on my door. We made love and then talked in the rumpled sheets. When you opened your mouth there were a thousand teeth, and you were hungry. To save myself I offered you my toothbrush, the handsoap, the old baking soda, everything in the pantry, the pots and pans, and the bags of garbage accumulating in the laundry room. You ate it all before I managed to restrain you. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> With your hands tied I looked at your face again. Your smile was so pretty! But when you opened your mouth I saw myriads. There were a thousand teeth and each tooth had a thousand teeth and so on. There was no end to their depth, there was no end to the visions they contained; the visions in your mouth, the visions in the wastelands of your mouth and in the shadows thrown over the wastelands of your mouth. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> In the endless dusk of the wastelands of your mouth I saw the Tree of Life, an orange tree entwined with a tangelo tree, and the widely-maligned money tree. I saw people wandering a desert, sunsets and sunrises following each other rapidly, a hyena crying in a purple sage bush, a museum of dreams and a museum of bad dreams and a museum of masks. You and I were trying the masks on, you were shouting years: 1753! and then: 1346, 1592! I laughed each time. I saw you and I riding the long tail of history, otherwise called <i>emigration</i> and sometimes <i>forced emigration.</i> I saw the hungry masses and the satiated masses and the masses who think they are unlucky in love. I saw endless promise, light and Holy Light, a picture of God posing half-nude with his lover, another picture of God posing at the beach in a black speedo, and an infinite body. I saw many invertebrates, a starfish for example; images on the face of the mountain succeeding one another rapidly; the deserts of Iran and the metaphorical deserts in the poetry of Iran; mirrors or the reflection of mirrors; light or the reflection of light; The Book of Fire and The Book of Water; love and the eternal promise of love, the eternal shadow of love, and the image of eternal love, which all look the same. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> In the bifurcating wastelands of your mouth I saw a woman who said: You are a very bad person; and another woman who said: You are a very good person; both resembled, but were not, my mother. I saw a young man banging a table with his fist shout: Discourse, discourse, discourse! Another young man said, at a reasonable volume: Dialectic, dialectic! And a young man crouching in the corner whispered: Logical abstraction. The words <i>style versus substance</i> floated over a black abyss and I laughed to myself. The words <i>form versus content</i> floated over the same abyss and I nodded thoughtfully. I saw in the distance a girl holding up what can only be described as <i>the last survey humanity will ever need to fill</i> and behind her, far behind her, a baby in a reed basket, and behind that there was only darkness. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> I said to you: Where did you find all that? And you said: Fear me, I am the Principle of Destruction. Then I woke up. </p>
