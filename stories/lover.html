<p class="paragraph"> I don't want to write short stories anymore. Why? Because they are a waste of time. A trashing of time, a flushing down the drain of time or down the toilet of time's waste or else a burning of time in the great fire heap of the bonfire of time. They are print fodder, they are mere copy, they are fodder for the cannons of disgruntled literary critics and for writers and would-be writers to waste their time on. They are a showcase, they are vanity, when Ecclesiastes spoke of the <em>vanity of vanities</em> she had in mind — she was after all a prophet — the future advent of the short story. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> I do not partake in vanity. I will only write what is pure and true, what will last in time, what will stand the test of time, what people will call true literature. I only write the best of literature, I only write long books — novellas at least but preferably novels that are four, five hundred pages long, or seven hundred pages long or preferably a thousand or a thousand one hundred pages long. If my prose wasn't good or my narrative was not good, people would say "This book is not good, this book is merely long," but that is not the case because my prose is good. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> You might think that with this attitude I have made many enemies. I don't have enemies. But I do have one person who is almost my enemy. He writes short stories and his name is Andrew Mohebbi. He writes long stories and also novellas, but he mostly writes short stories. Let me tell you about a short story Andrew Mohebbi wrote, if only to show you his perversity, his endless and bottomless perversity, his resourceful and limitless perversity. The story is titled <em>I Am God's Lover</em>, and the narrator of the story claims to be God's lover. The narrator is a thinly-veiled Andrew Mohebbi because Andrew Mohebbi loves writing about himself using characters that are thinly-veiled himselfs. And the narrator of <em>I Am God's Lover</em> is one such example. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The narrator of <em>I Am God's Lover</em> speaks about his sexual exploits with God, how he and God make love, and how they kiss and hold hands and walk down the pier holding hands, romantically, to watch the sunset, and how they touch each other and jack each other off and 69 and foreplay and how they fuck — more than anything how they fuck — from behind and missionary and sideways, and how God has three vaginas and 10 penises and two assholes and sometimes they do it in each other's butts at the same time, a simultaneous double penetration. The perversity of Andrew Mohebbi is such that <em>I Am God's Lover</em> discusses theological and metaphysical problems associated with being God's lover and especially with fucking (and being fucked by) God, as if descriptions of fucking God were not enough. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Here is an excerpt from <em>I Am God's Lover</em>: "God started vibrating and He started dancing and His limbs multiplied (specifically his feet multiplied). He had 10,000 feet dancing. I thought it was hot, all those feet. And so we made out and now we are lovers." You may think this is perverse but the most perverse thing about the story is that people loved it. Many people read it and many of those people loved it. Many people hated it too, but many more people loved it. I have written many short stories, many! I wrote them for years and some of them people loved, but none of them as much as <em>I Am God's Lover</em>. </p>
