<p class="info">&#9998; Feb 2024</p>
<p class="paragraph">The green pyramid with the grass beard. The reversal of expected events. Unexpected events in general. Betrayals and infamous traitors in the history of nations. The pyramid that eats nations and the pyramid that eats worlds. A black square. The abyss of the pyramid's mouth and the abyss as the mouth of some pyramid. The black square of dying without end. Flowers or us growing, decaying, and dying without end. Flowers that explode and flowers that don't explode. Explosions in general. The irreversible direction of death or the circular nature of death. Eyes on the face of death, eyes on the face of the abyss. Eyes in general. </p>
<p class="paragraph">Death and the crystal version of death. Water and its crystal version. Death and its brothers. Lava and the color of lava. Bones and more bones. The yellow fruit of death. Large colorful shapes that fit together badly. The animals in the dark. Oranges on stiff branches in the dark. The orange-breasted bird. Flowers that are big. The gold of luxury. Amoebas and creatures that have one eye. The face of the pyramid or the side of the pyramid. The massive stones of the pyramid and the worlds contained in the stones of the pyramid. The wall of the pyramid as the wall of the world. The hallucinations one has at the wall of the pyramid and the hallucinations the wall has itself. </p>
<p class="paragraph">The carved gods in the vision. The unending stacked gods. The sea of gods with hook faces and one eye. Colors to describe the gods such as yellow, orange, and lavender. Adjectives to describe the gods such as small, silent, and disarming. Ecstatic visions. The dreams one has and the dreams and visions that others have. Your hair or the pale reflection of your hair. Reflections of reflections. Standing on the mountain and allowing your hair to reflect down to me through the reflections of reflections. My love for you, a small golden pool. Crystalline silence and crystalline heaviness. Vividness and the concept of vividness. </p>
